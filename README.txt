*****Description:*****
This project contains three source code files that all perform different operations.

CountWordsInTextFile.java:
 * This program reads the text from a text file. 
 * The text file is passed as a command-line argument. Words are delimited by whitespace 
 * characters, punctuation marks (, ; . : ?), quotation marks (' "), and parentheses. Count words 
 * in case-insensitive fashion (e.g., consider Good and good to be the same word). 
 * The words must start with a letter. Display the output in alphabetical order of words, 
 * with each word preceded by its occurrence count

WordsInAscending.java:
 * displays words in ascending order of occurrence counts

CountOccurrenceOfNumbers.java:
 * This program reads an unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences. 
 * The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 –3 3320, the number 3 occurred most often. 
 * If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear 
 * twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.

***** BEFORE COMPILING ******
Use an IDE (I am using Eclipse) to run the source code.  

Before compiling: 
Create a Java project and copy in the source code files to run the programs.

You may use the wordtext.txt file in "Optional Input Files" or create your own .txt file to test the
CountWordsInTextFile.java prorgam.

To use the .txt file for CountWordsInTextFile.java:
1. Right click on your project name in Eclipse
2. Select "Run as" >> "Run Configurations"
3. Select the "Arguments" tab
4. Type in the name of the text file exactly in the "Program Arguments" text box.
5. Press Apply
6. Close
